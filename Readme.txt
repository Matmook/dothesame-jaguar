Hi all !

Here is the source code of "Do The Same" for Atari Jaguar.
You will need Atari's standard dev kit (I use it on Windows 98SE).

Removed files or informations (you could understand why ? :-) ) :
- most levels are removed (you've got the first 2 levels of each game mode for example)
- webcode generation removed 

Directory definition :
Bitmap : source tga files and resulting cry files
Gamesrc : game code
mooklib : all my ..hum .. ~core code
release : place where binary are after build (and cd creation directory too.)
sound : sample and mod files used in the game
core.s : main code start
build.bat : what to say...build the game

Sorry for the non-comments in the source code and sorry again because it's my first game (and it's my first asm code) so it should be unreadable !

Use this code as an example for your own project or as an example of what to not do on jaguar :-)

If you want help with this, you could contact me on Jagware or Atariage.

See you with another game !

Matmook and The "Do The Same" Team !
